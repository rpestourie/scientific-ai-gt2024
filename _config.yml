author: RaphaÃ«l Pestourie, Peng Chen, Ebeneser Fanijo, Yan Wang
description: This one-day workshop will convene experts in computational mathematics, statistics, data science, and application domain scientists across science and engineering to address the foundational topics of scientific AI for the prediction and optimization of complex systems (such as electromagnetic, corrosion science). The agenda emphasizes transcending conventional forward simulations and predictions to realize the optimization of complex systems at a large scale by harnessing the power of scientific AI.
